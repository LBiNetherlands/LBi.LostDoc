TODO

* rework xsl:sort in navigation2.xslt
  1. Generate unsorted output _with_ sort-key
  2. capture output in node-set
  3. Sort node-set on li/a/@sort-key


* method/types with generics need constraints in the C# syntax!

* add StatisticsBuilder and expose it so Repository can get nice statistics
  also reduces the line count in Template.cs

* add settings to the repository for custom feeds, etc

* sort out messed up Lostdoc URN Namespacing
  should be: urn:schemas-lbi-nl:lostdoc:template ??

* add command to generate a template NSdoc file (also with assembly level comment)

* create service template
